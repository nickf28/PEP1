# PEP1

As businesses constantly are collecting and storing data, anomalies may arise with the expansive dataset. To help combat this, our project will take company data about customers and orders, conduct a thorough examination, and remove anomalies, duplicates and redundancies. By doing so, we can provide the customer with a cleaned and transformed database which displays and makes use of originally unclean or erroneous data.

Teammates: Nick, Justin, Chi
